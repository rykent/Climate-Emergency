    To win the game you have to press space bar over any trash you see and put it into the garbage can.  To pick up a trash off the floor, you press space bar.
    Be careful because if you pick up an animal you will harm the environment and lose time. If you don't know what a space bar is, it is basically the button you use 
    to put in a break between words. It is located at the bottom center of your keyboard. To walk you use the left and right arrow keys
    which are situated at the bottom right side of the keyboard.
     
     The rest of the game is for you to discover and enjoy.
